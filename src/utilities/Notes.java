Currently, the form saves & retrieves ingredients to a file
    if continuing to save to a file:
        need to eliminate duplicates (equals, hashMap...)
        error comes up everytime ingredient is added
Need to check for empty string during ingredient when inputing amount (last entry above button)    
when deleting ingredient from table, it displays NaN, then tries to add/subtract to subtotals
The Ingredient running totals need to have precision set to one decimal    
    
NutritionLabel
    If you close window to add more ingredients:
        value does not carry back to main window
Need to be able to print label and ingredients
