MainWindow    
    Need to check for empty string ingredient when inputing amount (last entry above button)    
    Edit/Delete Buttons
        When deleting ingredient from table it displays NaN, then tries to add/subtract to subtotals
        The ingredient still shows up in Table #2 (Values in the actual label are correct)
            This should be fixed when adding the new class for saving list of ingredients
    The Ingredient running totals need to have precision set to one decimal   
    When searching for an ingredient, I want to be able to hit return to get results 
    Search Button: if blank when clicking button, 2 erros come up:
        1) please input an ingredient to search
        2) Ingredient not found
        
See UML-Diagram-Form-fall 2018.vsdx for new classes and current class revisions 
    Need to delete the Database references for now
    move GramEquivalent to Calculateor Class
    
Calculator class
    all members should be final
    methods should be static
    
NutritionLabel
    Need to be able to print label and ingredients    
    Add Buttons: Cancel, Save Recipe, Print
    Get rid of table and replace with a list of ingredients
        see Example file in CodeTinkering (below)
    Right justify totals in the Label 
    
DATABASE info
    make database connection class
    example files: 
        CodeTinkering -> database -> SimpleJdbc.java
        CodeTinkering -> collections -> iterating over recipe w/ingred using a HashMap
        WebTinkering -> servlets -> SimpleRegistration.java
