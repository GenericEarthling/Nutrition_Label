MainWindow    
Currently, the form saves & retrieves ingredients to a file
    if continuing to save to a file:
        need to eliminate duplicates (equals, hashMap...)
        error comes up everytime ingredient is added
Need to check for empty string during ingredient when inputing amount (last entry above button)    
    
NutritionLabel
    it loads, but info is not formated
    entering number of servings causes error
        I think it is because it is trying to access weight reference :/
    
DATABASE info
    make database connection class
    example files: 
        CodeTinkering -> database -> SimpleJdbc.java
        WebTinkering -> servlets -> SimpleRegistration.java
